									<h2>What is COVID-19</h2>
									<p>
                    COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus is a disease that directly attacks the lungs and can spread very quickly.<br />
                    <br />
                    It has infected roughly 2,000,000+ people these past few months, and most countries have went into lock down to avoid spreading further.<br />
                    <br />
                    It is usually transmitted if a person who is infected coughs or sneezes, or even exhales.<br />
                    <br />
                    You can be infected by someones breathing if youâ€™re within enough distance for the germs to be transmitted.<br />
                    <br />
                    Not many few people have recovered and many have died due to the circumstances of this virus.<br />

							<h2>Effects of COVID-19 on the body</h2>
							<p><h3>How does the virus spread?</h3>When an infected person sneezes, coughs, or breathes, droplets of their saliva and other bodily fluids could be in the air or on a surface that you touch. Once you have touched this, you can easily contract the virus by touching your nose, eyes, or mouth. This in turn will give the virus a passage into the mucous membranes in your throat. The time period in order to feel any symptoms is 14 days. These symptoms may include and are not limited to a sore throat, fever, or a dry cough. <br />
                    <br />Once the virus is inside of your body, it will move down your respiratory tract which includes your nose, mouth, throat, and lungs. The lower airways in your body carry more ACE2 receptors which would result in the COVID-19 virus traveling deeper than the common cold. <br />
                    <br />As a result of this, your lungs can become inflamed, making it difficult for you to breathe. This in turn can lead to pneumonia, an infection of the alveoli inside your lungs where your blood exchanges carbon dioxide and oxygen.</p>
